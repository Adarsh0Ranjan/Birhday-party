Rishik likes candies a lot. So, he went to a candy-shop to buy candies.

The shopkeeper showed him N packets each containg A[i] candies for cost of C[i] nibbles, each candy in that packet has a sweetness B[i]. The shopkeeper puts the condition that Rishik can buy as many complete candy-packets as he wants but he can't buy a part of the packet.

Rishik has D nibbles, can you tell him the maximum amount of sweetness he can get from candy-packets he will buy?
